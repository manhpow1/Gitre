            <h2>THE RABBIT</h2>
            <p class="info-text">Rabbits really do breed like rabbits. The female is ready to breed almost any time, and
                she'll have a litter of babies about 30 days after breeding. These herbivores eat a diet of mostly green
                foods, but they are also opportunistic feeders that will eat seeds, fruit, and bark. They live in large
                groups in underground tunnels called warrens with anything from a few to dozens of roommates.</p>
