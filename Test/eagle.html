            <h2>THE EAGLE</h2>
            <p class="info-text">Nicknamed the “king of all birds,” eagles are large and powerful birds of prey that
                appear to soar majestically in the air, searching for their next meal. Although not the most agile
                flyer, its remarkable speed in the air certainly belies its enormous size relative to other birds. Most
                species are well-protected by governments, conservation organizations, and international acts around the
                world, but a few of the more obscure species are in danger of extinction.</p>
