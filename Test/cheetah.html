            <h2>THE CHEETAH</h2>
            <p class="info-text">The Cheetah is a large and powerful feline that was once found throughout Africa and
                Asia and even in parts of Europe. Today however, it is found in only a few remote regions of its once
                vast natural range, primarily due to growing Human settlements and the hunting of them for their fur.
                There are widely considered to be five different subspecies of Cheetah that vary only very slightly in
                colouration and are most easily distinguished by their geographic location. </p>
