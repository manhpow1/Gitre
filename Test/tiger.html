            <h2>THE BENGAL TIGER</h2>
            <p class="info-text">One of the most wondrous and iconic animals to walk the Earth, Bengal tigers are
                majestic and rare. They're also one of the biggest cat species in the world. On average, Bengals are
                larger than other tiger species, but the largest tiger ever recorded was a Siberian. As such, Bengals
                are considered the second largest tiger species.</p>
