            <h2>THE ALLIGATOR</h2>
            <p class="info-text">Alligators are in the same family as other large reptiles like Crocodiles but are
                native to only two countries, which are the southern USA and China (where the Alligator is now nearly
                extinct). Alligators tend to be smaller than their Crocodile cousins but have been known to move at
                speeds of up to 15mph on land making them one of the fastest large reptiles in the world.</p>
